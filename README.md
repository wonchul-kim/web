# React

[Getting started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)

## To make a react project
```
npx create-react-app [project name]
```

`-g` 혹은 `global`로 `create-react-app`을 실행하는 것은 더 이상의 support가 없다고 하니, 위의 방식으로 진행하자.

* react는 `node`를 기반으로 프로젝트를 개발하기 때문에 `node`의 버전이 중요!
    * `nvm`이라는 [node version management](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)를 github에서 직접 설치하여 진행
    * `nvm install --lts`로 최신의 안정적인 버전의 `node`를 설치
    * 혹은 `nvm install [원하는 버전]`을 설치 (`nvm ls-remote`를 통해서 version을 search)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
